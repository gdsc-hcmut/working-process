## `Filling in information`

Firstly, Add a description that explains the purpose of the issue, including any details that might help resolve the issue.

Adding a task list by prefacing list items with `[ ]`:
+ When we add a task list to the body of an issue, the list has added functionality.
+ We can reference existing issues by issue number or URL
+ Appear in checkbox form with 2 state: complete ( `[ ]` ) incomplete ( `[x]` ).
+ Reordering tasks.
+ Navigating tracked issues: Any issues that are referenced in a task list specify that they are tracked by the issue that contains the task list.
