### Title

Should be descriptive and convey at a glance what the issue is about.

### Description

Firstly, Add a description that explains the purpose of the issue, including any details that might help resolve the issue.

Adding a task list by prefacing list items with `[ ]`:
+ When we add a task list to the body of an issue, the list has added functionality.
+ We can reference existing issues by issue number or URL
+ Appear in checkbox form with 2 state: complete ( `[ ]` ) incomplete ( `[x]` ).
+ Reordering tasks.
+ Navigating tracked issues: Any issues that are referenced in a task list specify that they are tracked by the issue that contains the task list. 

### Labels

Add a label to categorize the issue.

**Some default Label:**

| Label | Description |
|-----:|---------------|
|`bug` | 	Indicates an unexpected problem or unintended behavior |
|`documentation`  | Indicates a need for improvements or additions to documentation |
|`duplicate`  | 		Indicates similar issues, pull requests, or discussions |
|`enhancement`  | 	Indicates new feature requests |
|`good first issue` | 	Indicates a good issue for first-time contributors |
|`help wanted` |Indicates that a maintainer wants help on an issue or pull request |
|`invalid` | 		Indicates that an issue, pull request, or discussion is no longer relevant |
|`question` |	Indicates that an issue, pull request, or discussion needs more information |
|`wontfix` | Indicates that work won't continue on an issue, pull request, or discussion |
