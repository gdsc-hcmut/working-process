# Pull Request Conventions

## Title
- For a single commit, the title is the subject line of the commit message.
- Otherwise, the title should summarise the set of commits.

## Description
- Must state the why and the how for the change.
- Must explain the purpose of the PR.
- Explain any context.
- State what testing has been performed.
- You can [assign the issue to someone, choose a reviewers to review, add it to a project board, associate it with a milestone, or apply a label](../github_issue/README.md).

### Note
If the pull request is not ready to be review, we can set it as draft Pull Request:
