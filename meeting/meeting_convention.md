# Meeting convention

## Meeting time

- Should be frequent and fixed so that the leader can handle the working progress.
- **Suggested**: 3 meeting/ week, 2 days apart each time.

## Content of meeting

To ensure the quality of the meeting, the main content must be focused:
- **Report the previous task**: If the leader gives the task on the previous meeting, it should be done before creating the new one.
- **Report about the current task**: If any difficulty happens, exchange with the leader and other members in team.
- **Define the task for next meeting**: Remember to take note the task.
