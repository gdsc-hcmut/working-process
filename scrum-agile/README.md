## Definition
- Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices.
- **Scrum vs Agile**: *scrum is a framework for getting work done, whereas agile is a philosophy.*

## Members Of A Scrum Team

A scrum team needs three specific roles: product owner, scrum master, and the development team.

1. **product owner**
They are focused on understanding business, customer, and market requirements, then prioritizing the work to be done by the engineering team accordingly. Requirement:
- Build and manage the product backlog.
- Closely partner with the business and the team to ensure everyone understands the work items in the product backlog.
- Give the team clear guidance on which features to deliver next.
- Decide when to ship the product with a predisposition towards more frequent delivery.

2. **scrum master**
They coach teams, product owners, and the business on the scrum process, and look for ways to fine-tune their practice of it. Requirement:
- deeply understands the work being done by the team and can help the team optimize their transparency and delivery flow.
- schedules the needed resources (both human and logistical) for sprint planning, stand-up, sprint review, and the sprint retrospective.

3. **development team**
They are the champions for sustainable development practices.

The scrum team drives the plan for each sprint. They forecast how much work they believe they can complete over the iteration. Keeping the iteration length fixed gives the development team important feedback on their estimation and delivery process, which in turn makes their forecasts increasingly accurate over time.

## Scrum Artifacts

1. **Product Backlog**: a To Do list maintained by the product owner.

2. **Sprint Backlog**: list of items, selected by the Development team for implementation in the current sprint cycle.
- Before each sprint, in the sprint planning meeting, the team chooses which items it will work on for the sprint from the product backlog.
- A sprint backlog may be flexible and can evolve during a sprint, but the fundamental sprint goal can not be compromised.

3. **Increment (Sprint Goal)**: usable end-product from a sprint

## Scrum Events

1. **Organize the backlog**: This event is the responsibility of the product owner. He/She maintains this list using feedback from users and the development team to help prioritize and keep the list clean and ready to be worked on at any given time.

2. **Sprint planning**: The work to be performed (scope) during the current sprint is planned during this meeting by the entire development team. Requirements:
- Deciding the sprint goal.
- Adding specific user stories from the product backlog to the sprint.
- After meeting, every scrum member needs to be clear on what can be delivered in the sprint and how the increment can be delivered.

3. **Sprint**: is the actual time period when the scrum team works together to finish an increment. Usually, a sprint lasts two weeks. After a sprint, an increment (sprint goal) must be released.

4. **Stand up**: This is a frequently super-short meeting that happens at the same time and a place to keep it simple. During this meeting, these flow should be focused:
- **Report the previous task**: If there is any task on the previous meeting, it should be done before discussing the new one.
- **Solve the difficulty**: If any difficulty happens, we should exchange with other members in team to find the best solution.
- **Plan for the next task**: the leader creates task by Issues and assigns to other members.
**Suggested**: 3 meetings/week, 2 days apart each time.
